<p>Hello this game is a simple and fun mini-game. To play this game follow the instructions.</p>
<h2><u>1. Installing required Software</u></h2>
<p>Go to python.org and install python on your computer. Install Python for your current OS.</p>
<p>Open your terminal app and type either <code>python3</code> or <code>python</code> depending on your python version. If <code>python</code> does not work try <code>python3</code>. If the command returns <code>command not found</code> , try the other one. The game uses Pygame to Run so type <code>pip3 install pygame</code> or <code>pip install pygame</code> depending on your python version. After you type that pygame should install and it will be up and running on your computer.</p>
<p>The game also needs <code>os</code> , <code>sys</code> , <code>random</code> and <code>pathlib</code> Which are all pre installed but pathlib was only introduced in Python 3.4 so you will need a modern Python version</p>
