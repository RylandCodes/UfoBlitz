<h1>UfoBlitz</h1>
<p>Hello! This game is a simple and fun mini-game. To play this game follow the instructions.</p>
<h2><u>1. Installing Required Software</u></h2>
<p>Go to python.org and install python for your operating system.</p>
<p>Open your terminal app and type either <code>python3</code> or <code>python</code> depending on your python version. If <code>python</code> does not work try <code>python3</code>. If the command returns <code>command not found</code> , try the other one. The game uses pygame to run so type <code>pip3 install pygame</code> or <code>pip install pygame</code> depending on your python version. After you type that, pygame should install and it will be up and running on your computer.</p>
<p>The game also needs <code>os</code>, <code>sys</code>, <code>random</code> and <code>pathlib</code> which are all pre installed but pathlib was only introduced in Python 3.4, so you will need a modern Python version</p>

Open your terminal and type <code>cd Desktop/UfoBlitz</code> and then type <code>python main.py</code> or <code>python3 main.py</code>.
